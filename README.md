## 📌 About the Project
www.ayushaman.dev
This is a **frontend web application** built with **Next.js** and **Tailwind CSS**.

The project serves as a personal portfolio that showcases my **academic and professional journey**, providing an overview of my background, experience, and skills. It also features a curated list of the **projects and coursework** I have completed, highlighting both practical and academic work.

The goal of this project is to present my work in a clean, modern, and responsive interface while leveraging the performance and scalability benefits of Next.js.
